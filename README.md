#### Description
This project involves interfacing a DHT sensor with an Arduino to measure temperature and humidity. The readings from the sensor are displayed on an LCD screen or the serial monitor. This project introduces essential concepts of sensor interfacing, data reading, and display using Arduino.

#### Objective
The main objective of this project is to understand how to interface a DHT sensor with an Arduino to measure temperature and humidity and display these readings on an LCD screen or serial monitor. This project provides practical experience in working with sensors, data acquisition, and display methods.

#### Key Activities
1. **Sensor Interfacing**: Connect a DHT sensor to the Arduino to measure temperature and humidity.
2. **Data Acquisition**: Write a program to read data from the DHT sensor.
3. **Data Display**: Display the sensor readings on an LCD screen or the Arduino serial monitor.
4. **Simulation**: Use Tinkercad or a similar online platform to simulate the project if physical components are not available.

#### Technologies Used
- **Arduino Board**: The microcontroller used to interface with the DHT sensor and display the data.
- **DHT Sensor**: A sensor used to measure temperature and humidity.
- **LCD Screen**: Used to display the temperature and humidity readings .
- **Arduino IDE**: The integrated development environment used to write the code for the Arduino board.
- **Wokwi**: An online platform for designing and simulating electronic circuits .

#### Components Needed
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- DHTT sensor
- 16x2 LCD screen 


#### Steps:

1. **Sensor Interfacing**:
   - Connect the VCC pin of the DHT sensor to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
   - Connect the GND pin of the DHT sensor to the GND on the Arduino.
   - Connect the DATA pin of the DHT sensor to a digital pin (e.g., pin 2) on the Arduino.

2. **Data Display Setup** (for LCD):
   - Connect the LCD screen to the Arduino as per the standard 16x2 LCD connection .
   - Connects the pins with aurdino

3. **Programming the Arduino**:
   - Open the Arduino IDE.
   - Install the DHT sensor library .
   - Write the code.


4. **Simulation**:
   - Use Wokwi to create a virtual circuit.
   - Place an Arduino, DHT sensor, and LCD in the Wokwi workspace.
   - Connect the components as described in the Sensor Interfacing and Data Display Setup sections.
   - Write the Arduino code into the wokwi code editor.
   - Start the simulation to see the temperature and humidity readings.

5. **Testing**:
   - Upload the code to the Arduino board.
   - Open the serial monitor to view the temperature and humidity readings.
   - If using an LCD, the readings should also be displayed on the screen.

This project provides hands-on experience in sensor interfacing, data acquisition, and display using Arduino, making it an excellent exercise for learning embedded systems and IoT basics.
